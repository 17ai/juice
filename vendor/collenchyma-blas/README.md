collenchyma-BLAS provides full BLAS support for [Collenchyma][collenchyma],
so you can use BLAS operations on servers, desktops or mobiles with OpenCL, CUDA
and common host CPU support.

If you would like to write your own backend-agnostic, high-performance library, you can  
* take this library as an example for basically copy&paste,
* glance over the docs for a broader overview
* and [notify us about your library][gitter-collenchyma] - we are happy to feature your Collenchyma plugin
on the Collenchyma README.

collenchyma-BLAS was started at [Autumn][autumn] to support the Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf] with backend-agnostic, state-of-the-art performance.

For more information,

* see collenchyma-BLAS's [Documentation](http://autumnai.github.io/collenchyma-blas)
